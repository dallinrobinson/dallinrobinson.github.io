# Hi, I'm Dallin Robinson

Welcome! I’m a Statistics major at **Brigham Young University** with minors in **Mathematics** and **Business**. I’m passionate about using data and technology to solve meaningful problems and make better business decisions.

## Purpose of This Site

This site is my personal data science portfolio and learning journal. Here, I share my experiences, reflections, and key lessons from:

- Coursework in statistics, analytics, and machine learning
- Research and internships where I apply data-driven methods
- Independent projects and explorations in Python and R

I built this website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It’s designed to grow as I do — documenting my journey from student to professional data scientist.
