    "text": "Why Customer Segmentation Matters\nBusinesses rarely treat all customers the same. Instead, they group customers into segments based on characteristics like age, spending, or habits. This allows for:\n\nPersonalized marketing (ads that feel relevant, not random)\nSmarter product design (different products for different groups)\nBetter resource allocation (focus on high-value customers)\n\nAnd the cool part? You don’t need dozens of variables to see interesting patterns. Sometimes just age and annual spending are enough to show natural groupings."
